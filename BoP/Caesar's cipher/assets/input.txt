Example test text.
The history of London dates back many centuries. It has a very convenient geographical position and soon after the Roman conquest a small town turned into an important trade centre. London survived the plague which killed nearly 100 000 people and the Great fire when most of the city was destroyed. London can be divided into four main parts: the City, Westminster, the West End and the East End.
